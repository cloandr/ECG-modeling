# ECG Measurement Project 

**Context:** This modelisitation is being part of a semester project: ***Conception of an electronic module for pulse rate measurement***. The following scripts model the ECG signal to be used in device simulation. Starting with a clear ECG signal sourced from PhysioBank, I introduced noises and interferences to replicate real-life environmental conditions. The following sources of interference were considered:

- A 50 Hz noise to mimic interferences caused by input voltage.

- EMG noise, simulating patient muscle movement.

- Baseline noise modeling physiological perturbation such as breathing

**Results:** This work allowed us to observe the impact of these noises on the ECG signal. Subsequently, I utilized the final signals for hardware prototype simulation, with each stage focusing on the removal of one specific noise source. Our goal was to enhance the hardware design through simulation, ultimately achieving a clear ECG signal in a real-time environment. Upon completion of the project, the prototype underwent testing in a physical environment.
